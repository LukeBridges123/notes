# Definition
Recall that a linear functional on a vector space $V$ is defined to be a linear map $V \to \R$. The set of all linear functionals on $V$ is called the *dual space* of $V$ and denoted $V^*$. 
# Dimension of the Dual Space
That $\dim(V^*) = \dim(V)$ follows immediately from the general result that the space $L(V, W)$ of linear maps $V \to W$ has dimension $\dim(V) \cdot \dim(W)$; that $V^*$ is isomorphic to $V$ then follows from the fact that all vector spaces of the same dimension are isomorphic. 

However, we can also approach this problem in ways that do not directly rely on those results.
## Dual Basis
Given a basis $e_1, \dots, e_n$ of $V$, we can construct a basis of $V^*$, called the "dual basis" of the $e_i$ basis, as follows. Define a linear functional $\omega_i$ by $\omega_i(e_j) = \delta_{ij}$. Since any linear map is completely determined by its action on a basis of the domain, this is a perfectly
