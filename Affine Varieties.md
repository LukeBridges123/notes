# Definitions and Basic Results
A affine variety is the zero locus of a set of polynomials in $n$ variables. That is, given a set $S \subseteq K[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ of polynomials over some field, the set of all points $x$ in affine $n$-space $\A^n$ with $f(x) = 0$ for all $f \in S$ is an affine variety, denoted $V(S)$. 

When dealing with varieties we can restrict our attention from arbitrary sets of polynomials to ideals. This is because $V(S)$ is always equal to $V((S))$ where $(S)$ is the ideal generated by $S$. If $f, g$ are polynomials which vanish on $V(S)$, and $h$ is any polynomial, then $(f + g)(x) = 0$ and $(fh)(x) = 0$ for all $x \in S$; thus any element of $(S)$ vanishes on $V(S)$ and so $V((S)) \subseteq V(S)$. Clearly the other direction holds, so $V(S) = V((S))$. 

The [[Modules#Hilbert Basis Theorem|Hilbert Basis Theorem]] then implies that $(S)$ is finitely generated, say $(S) = (f_1, \dots, f_m)$, and so $V(S) = V(f_1, \dots, f_m)$. Thus any variety is the zero locus of a finite set of polynomials. 

The union of two varieties is another variety: we have $V(S) \cup V(T) = V(ST)$ where $ST$ is the set of all products $st$ with $s \in S, t \in T$. Any such product vanishes at $x$ iff $s(x) = 0$ or $t(x) = 0$, so if $x \in V(ST)$ then $x \in V(S)$ or $x \in V(T)$. Conversely if $x \in V(S)$, i.e. $s(x) = 0$ for all $s \in S$, then $(st)(x) = 0$ for all $st \in ST$, and the same for $V(T)$. Continuing inductively we get that any finite union of varieties is a variety. In terms of ideals, we have that $V(I) \cup V(J) = V(IJ)$ where $IJ$ is the ideal generated by products $fg$ with $f \in I, g \in J$. 

The intersection of arbitrarily many varieties is a variety. Letting $V(S_\alpha)$ be an indexed family of varieties, with index set $A$, we have $\cap_{\alpha \in A}V(S_\alpha) = V(\cup_{\alpha \in A}S_\alpha)$. This is essentially true by definition: $V(\cup_{\alpha \in A}S_\alpha)$ is the set of points $x$ such that any element of any set $S_\alpha$ vanishes at $x$, i.e. the set of all points which are in $V(S_\alpha)$ for all $\alpha$, which is just $\cap_{\alpha \in A}V(S_\alpha)$. In terms of ideals, we have $\cup_{\alpha \in A}V(I_\alpha) = V(\sum_\alpha I_\alpha)$; recall that we define the sum of infinitely many ideals to be the set of all finite sums $f_{\alpha_1} + \dots + f_{\alpha_n}$ where $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n \in A$. In particular $V(I) \cap V(J) = V(I + J)$. 

These two statements tell us that affine varieties behave like the closed sets of a topological space, since they are closed under arbitrary intersections and finite unions. This observation leads to the definition of the Zariski topology below. 

$V$ is "inclusion-reversing" or "contravariant" in the sense that, if $S \subseteq T$, then $V(S) \supseteq V(T)$. If $x \in V(T)$ then every polynomial in $T$ vanishes at $x$, so every polynomial in $S$ does as well, so $x \in V(S)$. 

We noted earlier that we can restrict our attention from arbitrary sets of polynomials to ideals. In fact we can to some extent restrict ourselves to *radical* ideals, since for any ideal $I$ we have $V(I) = V(\sqrt{I})$. One direction, $V(\sqrt{I}) \subseteq V(I)$, follows from the fact that $I \subseteq \sqrt{I}$. For the other direction, suppose $x \in V(I)$. Then for any $f \in \sqrt{I}$ we have $f^n \in I$ for some $n$) and so $f^n(x) = 0$, which implies $f(x) = 0$, and so all elements of $\sqrt{I}$ vanish at $x$. Thus $V(I) \subseteq V(\sqrt{I})$ and so $V(I) = V(\sqrt{I})$. 
# The Ideal-Variety Correspondence
We have already defined the variety $V(I)$ associated with an ideal $I$. Similarly for any variety $V$, we know that the set of all polynomials that vanish on $V$ form an ideal. We will denote this $I(V)$. Then these are *almost* inverses of each other: we have $V(I(X)) = X$ for any variety $X$, and $I(V(J)) = \sqrt{J}$ for any ideal $J$. This does mean that $V$ and $I$ give bijections between *radical* ideals and varieties, since if $J$ is radical we have $I(V(J)) = \sqrt{J} = J$. 
## Nullstellensatz
The above result ($V(I(X)) = X, I(V(J)) = \sqrt{J}$) is one form of Hilbert's "Nullstellensatz".
