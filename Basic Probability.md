# Heuristic Derivation of the Basic Rules of Probability
The following are often taken as axioms of probability, but we can give intuitive proofs (or heuristic arguments) for them using a sort of frequentist interpretation: the probability that an event will have a certain outcome, is the proportion of events that will (tend, on average) to have that outcome in a "large" sample. (So, for instance, the statement that there is a 50% probability of a coin coming up heads is taken to mean that, in a large sample of coin tosses, about 50% will come up heads.)
