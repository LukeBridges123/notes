When we pass from affine space to projective space, we replace points $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ with $n$ coordinates with "points" $(x_1, \dots, x_{n+1})$ with $n+1$ "homogenous" coordinates, i.e. where two points $p, q$ are the same if $p = \lambda q$ for some nonzero scalar $q$. Similarly, we replace curves (as general polynomials in two variables) with projective curves (as homogenous polynomials in three variables). Recall that a polynomial is homogenous if $f(\lambda x, \lambda y, \lambda z) = \lambda^3 f(x, y, z)$. We use homogenous polynomials to ensure that we can, to a limited extent, regard them as functions of points in $\mathbb{P}^n$ with their homogenous coordinates. The zero locus of a homogenous polynomial is well-defined in the sense that, if $p, q = \lambda p$ are different representations of the same point in the projective plane, then $f(q) = f(\lambda p) = \lambda^3 f(p) = \lambda^3 \cdot 0 = 0$; thus whether a point is in the zero locus of a homogenous polynomial does not depend on what representation in homogenous coordinates we choose for it. On the other hand the "value" of a homogenous polynomial at any point not in the zero locus is not similarly well-defined. 

(On the other hand rational functions $f/g$ where $f, g$ are both homogenous and have the same degree, *are* well-defined in this sense, as long as $g$ does not vanish, since we have $f(\lambda p)/g(\lambda p) = \lambda^3 f(p) / \lambda^3 g(p) = f(p)/g(p)$. )

We can now define, by analogy with [[Affine Algebraic Curves|affine curves and varieties]], a *projective curve* as the zero locus (in the projective plane) of a homogenous polynomial in 3 variables, and a projective variety as the common zero locus of any number of homogenous polynomials.
