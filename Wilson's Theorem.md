# Wilson's Theorem
Wilson's Theorem is an important consequence of the existence of multiplicative inverses modulo p, where p is a prime, for every number not divisible by p. Its statement is as follows: for every prime p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p). Proof: when p = 2, it is true because 1 ≡ -1 (mod 2). For odd primes, consider the set {2, 3, ... (p-2)}. We know that every number not congruent to 0 (mod p) has a multiplicative inverse mod p; we also know that 1 and p-1 are their own multiplicative inverses mod p. As for the ones in the set {2, 3, ... (p-2)}, that set can be divided up into pairs of numbers such that each number is the other's multiplicative inverse mod p, i.e. such that the product of the two numbers is congruent to 1 mod p. Since each pair's product is congruent to 1 mod p, the product of the pairs is also congruent to 1 mod p; and since (p-2)! is equal to the product of all those pairs, (p-2)! ≡ 1 (mod p). Multiplying both sides by (p-1) gets (p-1)! ≡ (p-1) ≡ -1 (mod p). 

The converse of Wilson's Theorem is also true, i.e. if (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p), then p is prime. This can be proven by proving its contrapositive. If p is composite, then there is at least 1 element of the set {2, 3, ... (p-1)} which divides p and thus is not relatively prime to p. Therefore, (p-1)! must also not be relatively prime to p; and it can be shown that, as a result, (p-1)! cannot be congruent to -1 (mod p). (If x is some integer which is not relatively prime to p--in particular, suppose that x and p are both divisible by some integer y which is greater than 1--then x + 1 will not be divisible by y. And if x + 1 is not divisible by y, then it certainly is not divisible by p, so x must not be congruent to -1 mod p.) It follows that (p-1)! is not congruent to -1 (mod p), since it is not relatively prime to p. Thus, we have established that if p is composite, then (p-1)! is not congruent to -1 (mod p); and this is equivalent to the statement that if (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p), then p is prime.

Wilson's theorem and its converse provide a basis for a [primality test algorithm](Primality%20testing.md).
