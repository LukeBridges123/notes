# Discrete Fourier Transform
First we explain what it is that the FFT computes, namely the *discrete Fourier transform* of a sequence of numbers. Recall that the Fourier transform $\hat{f}$ of a function is given by $\hat{f}(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{-2\pi xt}dt$. We might try to approximate this by finding $\hat{f}(x)$ for some well-chosen values of $x$, and then try to calculate those values of $\hat{f}(x)$ by discretizing the corresponding integral (which we limit to a finite domain, instead of trying to integrate over the whole real line). Without going into the details, it turns out that we can do this by evaluating a sum of the form $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(t_i) \omega_n^{-mi}$ where $m$ is an integer, $\omega_n$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity, and the $t_i$ are chosen in a certain way. 

We can abstract this further, moving from $f(t_i)$ to any sequence of numbers $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$ and consider the problem: given such a finite sequence, compute the sequence $b_m$ defined by $b_m = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \omega_n^{mi}$. This sequence $b_0, \dots, b_{n-1}$ is called the *discrete Fourier transform* of $a_0, \dots, a_{n-1}$. (Note that we removed the minus sign from the exponent, which we had in the paragraph above. Conventions differ as to whether the DFT involves sums like $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \omega_n^{mi}$ or $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \omega_n^{-mi}$; here we will use the former convention.)
## The DFT Matrix
The DFT of a sequence $a_i$ can be expressed in matrix form, as $$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 \\1 & \omega_n & \omega_n^2 & \cdots &  \omega_n^{n-1} \\ 1 & \omega_n^2 & \omega_n^4 & \cdots &  \omega_n^{2(n-1)} \\ \vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\ddots & \vdots\\ 1 & \omega_n^{n-1} & \omega_n^{2(n-1)} & \cdots &  \omega_n^{(n-1)(n-1)} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}a_0 \\ a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_{n-1}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}b_0 \\ b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_{n-1}\end{pmatrix}$$ where the vector of $a_i$s is the input sequence and the vector of $b_i$s is its DFT. 

## Inverse DFT
An important fact about the DFT matrix is that it is "almost unitary": letting $A$ be an $n \times n$ DFT matrix, we have $A^*A = nI$. Thus we can invert the DFT by multiplying by $\frac{1}{n}A^*$. 

To show this, we need to show that $v_i^*v_j = n\delta_{ij}$ where $v_i$ is the $i$th column of the matrix. First note that, for any $\omega_n$, we have $\ol{\omega_n^j} = \omega_n^{-j}$. This is because $\omega_n^j = e^{2\pi ij/n}$, and the complex conjugate of that is $e^{-2\pi ij/n} = e^{2\pi (-j)in} = \omega_n^{-j}$. Thus, since $v_i = (1, \omega_n^i, \omega_n^{2i}, \dots, \omega_n^{(n-1)i})$, we have $v_i^* = (1, \omega_n^{-i}, \dots, \omega_n^{-(n-1)i})$. 

Consider first taking the dot product $v_i^*v_i$; this will be equal to $1 + \omega_n^i \cdot \omega_n^{-i} + \dots + \omega_n^{(n-1)i} \cdot \omega_n^{-(n-1)i} = 1 + 1 + \dots + 1 = n$. Now take $v_i^* v_j$ with $i \neq j$. We get $1 + \omega_n^{i-j} + \omega_n^{2(i-j)} \dots + \omega_n^{(n-1)(i-j)}$. This is a geometric series with $n-1$ terms and common ratio $\omega_n^{i-j}$; its sum is $\frac{1 - (\omega_n^{i-j})^n}{1 - \omega_n^{i-j}} = \frac{1 - (\omega_n^n)^{i-j}}{1 - \omega_n^{i-j}} = \frac{1 - 1^{i-j}}{1 - \omega_n^{i-j}} = 0$. 

Thus, the columns of $A$ are orthogonal, and $A^*A = nI$. This implies that we can take the inverse of the DFT by multiplying by the matrix $\frac{1}{n}A^*$, or $$\frac{1}{n}\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 \\1 & \omega_n^{-1} & \omega_n^{-2} & \cdots &  \omega_n^{-(n-1)} \\ 1 & \omega_n^{-2} & \omega_n^{-4} & \cdots &  \omega_n^{-2(n-1)} \\ \vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\ddots & \vdots\\ 1 & \omega_n^{-(n-1)} & \omega_n^{-2(n-1)} & \cdots &  \omega_n^{-(n-1)(n-1)} \end{pmatrix}$$ Note that this looks much like a DFT matrix, just with negative signs in all the exponents; we can get it simply by replacing $\omega_n$ with $\omega_n^{-1}$. We will see that, because of this, we can take inverse DFTs using the same algorithm that we use to take DFTs.
