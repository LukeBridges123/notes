# Definition
A field is a commutative [[Rings|ring]] in which all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse. (We also add, to exclude the zero ring, that $0 \neq 1$.)
# Examples
The standard examples of fields are $\Q, \R, \C$, and the integers modulo a prime $p$. Further examples tend to be built out of those basic ones. For example, we can construct fields by adjoining elements to existing fields, or equivalently, by taking quotients of polynomial rings; this is done in [[Rings]]. This leads to, for example, $\Q[\sqrt{2}]$ and $\Q[i]$.
# Relation Between Rings and Fields
We know that any integral domain can be embedded naturally into a field, namely the field of fractions. Conversely, if a ring $R$ is a subring of a field $F$, then $R$ is an integral domain: if $xy = 0$ with $x, y \in R$ and $x$ and $y$ both $0$ (say WLOG $x \neq 0$), we can cancel $x$ using its inverse from $F$ to get $y = 0$, as desired.
