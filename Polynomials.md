# Symmetric Polynomials
A polynomial in $n$ variables, i.e. in $R[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is symmetric if, roughly speaking, rearranging the variables doesn't change the polynomial. More formally, letting $\sigma \in S_n$, we must have $p(x_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(n)}) = p(x_1, \dots, x_n)$. For example, with 3 variables, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2$ and $x_1x_2x_3$ would be examples, while $x_1^2x_2$ would not be, since swapping $x_1$ and $x_2$ turns this into a different polynomial. These are important because of Vieta's formulas: the coefficients of a polynomial are symmetric functions of its roots. More precisely, the coefficient on the $x^k$ term is (up to a factor of $\pm 1$ ) the $k$th "elementary symmetric polynomial" on $n$ variables, i.e. the sum of all possible products of $k$ different variables from the $n$ available. More formally, if $1 \leq k \leq n$, the $k$the elementary symmetric polynomial is $e_k(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \sum_{i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k}x_{i_1}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_k}$  Then Vieta's formulas say that $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\cdots(x-r_n) = x^n + \sum_{k = 1}^n (-1)^k e_k(r_1, \dots, r_n)x^{n-k}$.  

Not all symmetric polynomials are elementary: just look at $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2$. But we do have the following:
## Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials
This states that every symmetric polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial of the elementary symmetric polynomials. 

For example, in the example of $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2$, we can express it as $(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)^2 - 2(x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3) = e_1^2 - 2e_2$. 

Proof: each polynomial in $n$ variables is written as a sum of monomials in $n$ variables; we can order these lexicographically: compare the exponents on $x_1$, then on $x_2$ if there's a tie, and so on. So $x_1x_2$ comes before $x_1^2x_2$, $x_1x_2$ comes before $x_1x_2^2$, and $x_1x_2^2$ comes before $x_1x_2^2$. More formally, given $\mu = x_1^{a_1} \cdots x_n^{a_n}, \nu = x_1^{b_1} \cdots x_n^{b_n}$, we look at the vectors of exponents, $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ and $(b_1, \dots, b_n)$ and compare them lexicographically. This then defines a total order on all the monomials in $n$ variables. If $p(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is a symmetric polynomial, then it has a "largest" monomial in our ordering. This monomial $\mu_{max}$ must have its exponents monotonically decreasing, $a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \dots \geq a_n$--if not, just permute the variables to make the exponents monotonically decreasing, and the monomial you get must also appear in $p$ if $p$ is symmetric.

## The Discriminant
We know from the quadratic formula $\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ that a polynomial with real coefficients $ax^2 + bx + c$ will have $2$ distinct real roots if $b^2 - 4ac > 0$, one real root with multiplicity $2$ if $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, and 2 distinct complex roots otherwise. Indeed the quadratic formula holds over arbitrary fields as long as the characteristic is not $2$, where it at least tells us that the quadratic has a repeat root if $b^2 - 4ac = 0$. 

Similar expressions, telling you how many distinct roots a polynomial has, can come from the cubic and quartic formulas. For higher degrees, there is no such formula, but still something that can tell you when there are repeated roots: the discriminant. 

Let $p(x) = (x - r_1)\cdots(x - r_n)$. The discriminant $\Delta$ of $p$ is defined to be $\prod_{i < j}(r_i - r_j)^2$. It is a symmetric polynomial of the roots, with degree $\binom{n}{2} \cdot 2 = n(n-1)$, which is $0$ if and only if two of the roots are equal. By the fundamental theorem, we can write it in terms of elementary symmetric function of the roots--but those are just the coefficients of the polynomial! So in fact we can tell just from the coefficients, without finding any roots, whether there are repeated roots. 

For example, for a monic quadratic $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$ we have, $\Delta = (r_1 - r_2)^2 = r_1^2 - 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2 = e_1^2 - 4e_2$. But $e_1(r_1, r_2) = b$ and $e_2(r_2, r_2) = c$, so the discriminant is $b^2 - 4c$. If this is $0$ then there is a repeated root, which is true of any field. In the reals, if negative, $r_1 - r_2$ must be imaginary, so we must have complex roots, and so, if positive, the roots must be real and distinct. 

Now consider a monic cubic $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$, which factors as $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)$. This gives a discriminant of $(r_1 - r_2)^2(r_1 - r_3)^2(r_2 - r_3)^2$. With enough bashing, we find that we can write this as $e_1^2e_2^2 - 4e_2^3 - 4e_1^3e_3 - 27e_3^2 + 18e_1e_2e_3$, or $a^2b^2 - 4b^3 - 4a^3c - 27c^2 + 18abc$. If we make the linear change of variables that turns it into the depressed cubic $x^3 - px + q$ this reduces down to $-4p^3 - 27q^2$. As before, $\Delta = 0$ implies a repeated root in any field, while in the reals, we have that a positive discriminant implies all real roots while a negative discriminant implies 1 real and 2 complex roots. 
# Polynomials over Q and Z

## Irreducible Polynomials in Q and Z
If we had a good way to figure out which polynomials are irreducible (especially over $\Q$), we could use that to get a lot of information about field extensions. In the degree $2$ or $3$ case, we can use the rational root theorem, but more generally, there are 2 main tools: Gauss' lemma and Eisenstein's criterion.

Gauss' lemma: let $f(x) \in \Z[x]$ be irreducible in $\Z[x]$,i.e. does not factor into integer polynomials; then it is irreducible over $\Q$ as well. 

Eisenstein's criterion: let $f(x) = c_0 + c_1x + \dots + c_nx^n \in \Z$[x]. If there exists some prime number $p$ such that $p$ does not divide $c_n$, $p$ does divide all the other coefficients, and $p^2$ does not divide $c_0$, then $f$ is irreducible over $\Q$. 
### Eisenstein's Criterion
Proof: suppose $f(x) = a(x)b(x)$ where $a(x), b(x)$ have degree more than $0$ and less than $\deg(f)$. Now consider the map $\pi: \Z[x] \to Z[x]/(p)$ where you just reduce the coefficients mod $p$. This is a ring homomorphism, and so $\overline{f(x)} = \overline{a(x)}\cdot \overline{b(x)}$. By our assumptions about the coefficients of $f(x)$, when we reduce $f(x)$ mod $p$ we're left with $\overline{c_n}x^n$. Thus $\overline{a(x)}$ and $\overline{b(x)}$ must be monomials, else their product would not be a monomial; thus $\overline{c_n}x^n = \overline{a_k}x^k\overline{b_{n-k}}x^{n-k}$. Since reducing $a$ and $b$ mod $p$ leaves us with nonconstant monomials, reducing $a$ and $b$ mod $p$ gets rid of their constant terms, so $a_0$ and $b_0$ must be divisible by $p$, so $c_0$ is divisible by $p^2$, a contradiction. (N.B. we must have $k > 0$, otherwise $p$ would divide $c_n$.)
### Gauss' Lemma

We can study irreducible integer polynomials using rational polynomials, via Gauss' lemma: if $p(x) \in \Z[x]$ is irreducible, then it is also irreducible in $\Q[x]$. Proof: we note first--we will use this repeatedly later--that, since $p(x)$ is irreducible in $\Z[x]$, its coefficients must be coprime, since otherwise we could factor $p(x)$ by pulling out the gcd of the coefficients (which is not a unit, so this does show that $p(x)$ is reducible.) Now assume that $p(x) = f(x)g(x)$ in $\Q[x]$, where $f$ and $g$ are both non-constant. We can then clear denominators: more formally, there exists $c, d \in \Q$ such that $cf(x), dg(x) \in \Z[x]$. (For convenience, let $F(x)$ and $G(x)$ be the scaled $f$ and $g$; if we pick $c$ and $d$ right, the coefficients of $F$ will all be coprime, and the same for $F$, so we can assume WLOG that this is the case.) 

We now want to show that $cd = \pm 1$: in that case, $p(x) = \pm cf(x)dg(x) = \pm F(x)G(x)$ which would give a factorization of $p$ in $\Z[x]$. (Thus proving that, if $p$ is reducible over $\Q$, then it is reducible over $\Z$.) We have $cdp(x) = F(x)G(x)$; suppose that $cd = a/b$, with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Then $ap(x) = bF(x)G(x)$--the LHS and RHS are both in $\Z[x]$. $b$ divides the RHS, implying that $b$ divides the LHS, but since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we must have that $b$ divides $p(x)$, but since the coefficients of $p(x)$ are all coprime, $b$ must be $\pm 1$. Thus $ap(x) = \pm F(x)G(x)$. If $a$ is not $\pm 1$ then it has a prime divisor $q$ (possibly equal to $a$). Since $q|F(x)G(x)$ and $q$ is prime, it must divide the coefficients of $F$ or the coefficients of $G$, which is impossible since we chose $F(x)$ and $G(x)$ in such a way that their coefficients are all coprime. (To prove this properly: let $F = \alpha_0 + \dots + \alpha_nx^n$, $G = \beta_0 + \dots + \beta_mx^m$. Then since the coefficients of $F$ are coprime, and the same for $G$, there exists $\alpha_i, \beta_j$ such that $\alpha_i$ is not divisible by $p$, but all the lower-indexed coefficients are, and the same for $\beta_j$. If we look at the $x^{i+j}$ term of $F(x)G(x)$, its coefficient is $\alpha_i\beta_j  + \alpha_{i-1}\beta_{j+1} + \dots + \alpha_{i+1}\beta_{j-1} + \dots$ So aside from the $\alpha_i\beta_j$ term, all of these contain an $\alpha$ with index less than $i$, or a $\beta$ with index less than $j$, and so are divisible by $q$. But then their sum is a multiple of $q$ (everything except $\alpha_i\beta_j$)  plus a nonmultiple of $q$, so is not a multiple of $q$. This contradicts the assumption that $q$ divides all the coefficients of $F(x)G(x)$.) Thus $a$ must actually be $\pm 1$. Thus $cd = \pm 1$, so $p(x)$ factors as $F(x)G(x)$ or $-F(x)G(x)$, either of those being a factorization into integer polynomials. 
### Rational Root Theorem
The rational root theorem is a corollary of this: let $p(x) = c_nx^n + \dots + c_0$ be an integer polynomial; then if $p$ has a rational root $\frac{a}{b}$, with $a, b$ coprime, then $a$ must divide the constant term $c_0$ and $b$ must divide the leading coefficient $c_n$. Proof: viewing this as a polynomial in $\Q[x]$, $p$ must be reducible over $\Q$, equal to $(x - r)q(x)$ where $q(x) \in \Q[x]$. But then $(bx - a)(\frac{1}{b}q(x)$) is a factorization in $\Z[x]$. (Note that $\frac{1}{b}q(x)$ must be an integer polynomial, since ) If you multiply these out, then the leading term of $p$ is $b$ times the leading term of $\frac{1}{b}q(x)$, so $b$ divides $c_n$, and similarly for $a$ dividing $c_0$.
