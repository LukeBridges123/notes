# Enumerative Combinatorics
[[Pigeonhole Principle]]
[Enumeration rules](Enumeration%20rules.md)
Multiplication, addition, and subtraction principles; permutations; counting subsets; multisets; stars and bars. 
[Binomial and multinomial coefficients](Binomial%20and%20multinomial%20coefficients.md)
Binomial coefficient identities: Pascal's identity, Vandermonde's identity, etc. The binomial and multinomial theorems. Generalization to non-integer exponents. Binomial inversion. 
[[Set Partitions]]
Compositions and weak compositions. Set partitions. Stirling numbers of the second kind: recurrences, explicit formula, and other identities. Bell numbers. 
[[Integer Partitions]]
Ferrers shapes; a few identities proved with them. Ordinary generating functions applied to partitions.
[[Cycles and Inversions in Permutations]]
Inversions in permutations. Counting permutations with a specified number of inversions. Sign of a permutation; permutation matrices. Cycle decomposition. Counting permutations with a specified cycle structure. Stirling numbers of the first kind; counting permutations with a specified number of cycles. Derangements.
[[Inclusion-Exclusion]]
General statement of inclusion-exclusion. Generating functions applied to inclusion-exclusion. Applications: explicit formulas for derangements and Stirling numbers of the second kind.
[[Generating Functions]]
Operations on formal power series in general; Wilf rules for ogfs and egfs. Solving recurrences with ogfs; general results on linear homogenous recurrence relations. Combinatorial interpretation of products and compositions of ogfs and egfs. Examples: Fibonacci numbers, Catalan numbers, integer partitions, derangements, Bell numbers. 

[[Fibonacci Numbers]]
